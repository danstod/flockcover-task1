Assumptions

1. No authentication is required
2. The data is fairly static and gets updated approx. once a week (and hence this will dictate the cache expiry)


In addition to your code, please submit a brief document (as a README or otherwise), answering the following questions(brief answers will suffice):
- What assumptions did you have to make?
- Which technologies did you choose? Why?
- What technical compromises did you have to make in order to achieve your solution? What is the severity of this tech debt, and what would a path to resolving it look like?
- How do we run your code?
- What future features do you think we might be able to build based on this API?
